PROOF OF CONCEPT SCRIPTS FOR WCONSOLE UTILITY
---------------------------------------------

To provide a wireless remote serial port, you will need:

 - a supported wireless adapter plugged in to one port of the WLANPi (e.g. CF-912ac)
 - a compatable USB to serial cable in the other USB port (e.g. Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303
   Serial Port)

Before attempting to use WCONSOLE, you must install the ser2net packge on your WLANPi. To install 
the package, perform the following steps:

1. Connect your WLANPI via the Ethernet port to a network with Internet access
2. SSH to the WLANPi and login
3. execute the following commands:
    apt-get update
    apt-get install ser2net

Once ser2net is installed, copy the supplied rconsole gzipped archive to the WLANPi to the /etc 
directory of the WLANPI (see "bundle" github folder). Extract the files from the archive using
the command:

 tar xvfz wconsole.tar.gz

Change to the newly created directory /etc/rconsole:

 cd /etc/wconsole

Run the installation script to configure hostapd, ser2net and open up port 9600 in ufw:

 sudo ./wconsole_switcher install

Flip the WLANPi in to rconsole mode:

 sudo ./wconsole_switcher on

At this point, the WLANPi will reboot. Following the reboot, an SSID of WCONSOLE will be available
on channel 1. Join the SSID and use the PSK: Password1.

Once you have joined the SSID, open a telnet session to 192.168.42.1:9600. This will provide access
to the serial console cable plugged in to the USB port.

To switch out of rconsole mode, connect the WLANPi to a network via the Ethernet port, SSH to it 
and run the command: sudo /etc/wconsole/wconsole_switcher off
