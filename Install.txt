==========

To provide a wireless remote serial port, you will need:

 - a supported wireless adapter plugged in to one port of the WLANPi (e.g. CF-912ac)
 - a compatible USB to serial cable in the other USB port (e.g. Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303
   Serial Port)
 - a WLANPi with 2 USB sockets (only avaiable on more recent models)

Before attempting to use WCONSOLE, you must install the ser2net packge on your WLANPi. To install 
the package, perform the following steps:

 1. Connect your WLANPI via the Ethernet port to a network with Internet access
 2. SSH to the WLANPi and login
 3. execute the following commands:
     apt-get update
     apt-get install ser2net

Once ser2net is installed, copy the supplied wconsole gzipped archive to the WLANPi to the /etc 
directory of the WLANPI (see "bundle" github folder). Extract the files from the archive using
the command:

 tar xvfz wconsole-v0.04.tar.gz
 
Installation is now complete. If you are using the native WLANPi front panel menu system to flip modes (which is available from image ver v1.7 & highly recommended!) and activate the Wi-Fi console, you do not need to do anything else.

To flip in to the Wi-FI console mode via the CLI, change to the newly created directory /etc/wconsole:

 cd /etc/wconsole

Flip the WLANPi in to wconsole mode:

 sudo ./wconsole_switcher on

At this point, the WLANPi will reboot. Following the reboot, an SSID of wifi_console will be available
on channel 1. Join the SSID and use the PSK: wifipros.

Once you have joined the SSID, open a telnet session to 192.168.42.1:9600. This will provide access
to the serial console cable plugged in to the USB port.

To switch out of wconsole mode, connect the WLANPi to a network via the Ethernet port, SSH to it 
and run the command: sudo /etc/wconsole/wconsole_switcher off
